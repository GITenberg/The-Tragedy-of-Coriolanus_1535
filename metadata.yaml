description: The plays in the New Kittredge Shakespeare series retain their original
  Kittredge notes and introductions, changed or augmented only when some modernization
  seems necessary. These new editions also include introductory essays by contemporary
  editors, notes on the plays as they have been performed on stage and film, and additional
  student materials.
